# Introduction
This repository contains my private scripts, I use for diverse cases in my favorite shell.
The version managament with an origin is used as backup mechanism, distribution on different devices and sharing.
Notes here are not meant to give a complete instruction for everyone. Issues will be ignored.
If you should find something particular, feel free to use it by your own. But do not expect any help.

# Add 2 Path
Edit the `~/.bashrc` and paste in the following:
> PATH="/path/to/script/folder:$PATH"

_Zsh_ can use the runtime configuration of the bash, so no adjustments required here.
